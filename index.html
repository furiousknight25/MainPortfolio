            <h4>Relaxing in the summer.</h4> 
            <p>At the moment this website is heavy WIP. But with enough freetime saved up, I can spend more time on a cool 
                portfolio.
            </p>
            <h3>Obligatory comp for college section</h3>
            <p>The purpose of my website is to display my growth as a writer through the course.  I hope to showcase my ability to write different kinds of papers, use different styles of citing and types of research material, and express my ideas clearly. </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I chose this class because writing is my weakest skill. I knew it would've been hard annoying work, but the class turned out to be suprisngly fun and rewarding.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    My biggest weakest in writing is sumarizing research into consise, well sourced paragraphs. Often I do lots of research and come up with a 1000 things to say, but in the end it turns my paper into ramblings.
                </li>
                <li>2 writers who have inspried me are <a href="https://ncase.me/" target="_blank">Nicky Case</a> and Mrs. Kartak. What I love about both of these writers is the emphasis on teaching through multimodal ways. 
                Both teachers put lots of effort into conveying a message in an entertaining and quick way. I dream to create papers and work that can teach at the same efficeny.</li>
